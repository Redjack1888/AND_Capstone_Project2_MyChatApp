# AND_Capstone_Project2_MyChatApp

## _Why this Project?_
In this project, you I demonstrate the skills I've learned in your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of my own. By the end of this project, I will have an app that I can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

## _What Will I Learn?_
The Capstone project will give me the experience I need to own the full development cycle of an app.

## _Required Tasks_
- Successfully complete [**Stage 1**](https://github.com/Redjack1888/Capstone-Stage-1---Design).
- Build the app using your [**Stage 1 document**](https://github.com/Redjack1888/Capstone-Stage-1---Design/blob/master/Capstone_Stage1-MyChatApp-final-definitive%20.pdf) as a guide.
- Submit the app source code through the Nanodegree project portal.
